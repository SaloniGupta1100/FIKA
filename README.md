## Problem it Solves
Ever went to a doctor and was asked “When was your last period?”. Almost everyone who bleeds gets invited to answer this question at some point while their visit to their doctor and most of the time we are unsure about it.
Everyone is different and experiences different symptoms during their cycle. Tracking them will help us make sense of ‘why am I like this?’ in the future, so we can be kind to ourselves, set healthy expectations, and achieve our goals in life!
We made Fika to help people irrespective of their gender to understand their bodies and their cycles better.
It is intended to make the users realize that their periods may not be the only part of their cycle of 28 days but it certainly is one of the most crucial parts.
Fika helps you in tracking your periods, shows your previous periods logs so that you and your doctor can save the time spent calculating the hard maths, and even predict when your next cycle may occur.
It gives you the flexibility of setting the cycle length and the period length ourselves so that we can be assured that the predictions given are the best to our knowledge.
As there are logs provided in the WebApp the app will also come in handy to know when our luteal phase usually starts and helps in aiding the user in birth control giving them a larger bodily autonomy and the power to choose what’s best for them.
Along with this it also has some white noises to make us feel better when we really need to cut and give some much-needed relaxation to our bodies like rain, cafe, forest, etc.
To save users from losing their information again whenever they change a device Fika also provides them with an option to sync this app with their google calender so that their health is never compromised. This project was a small step by us to make a change in the world regarding the autonomy women have on their bodies and empower women of different communities to be an inspiration to others

## Challenges we ran into
1. Logic behind the period tracker was hard to grasp, we had to explore many different websites and articles to understand how our cycle actually works and sometimes even had to revisit our 12th class biology textbooks.
2. Exporting details from local Storage
3. Integrating calender intro the WebApp
4. Taking Backup using Google calendar.
4. Had to explore various websites in order to research what actually people are listening to nowadays in order to calm their minds.
5. It was our first time developing something as a music player so writing a JS code was something I spent the most time on.
